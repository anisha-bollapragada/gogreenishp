          JUNE GLOOM IN CALIFORNIA IS THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        Most local Californian citizens know that May and June are a toss-up for the weather. Oftentimes, California has a tendency to have gray days during these hot and long summer months.
      </p> 

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        “June gloom” is due to the cooling marine layer of stratus clouds that stretch our coastline. Believe it or not, the marine layer serves a vital environmental role. This protective layer of clouds keeps us and our ecosystem cool and moist during the hot summer weather. However, it is disappearing due to harsh climate conditions. 
      </p>

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        This summer, beachgoers can expect clearer skies. On paper, this might seem like a positive. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. The marine layer is essential in keeping stable weather in California during the hottest months of the year. Due to this, beachgoers should prepare to apply lots of sunscreen! Protecting your skin from UV rays will be vital this year as California braces for a grim summer of heat and drought. 
      </p>

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        A study published in 2018 discovered that the frequency of coastal stratus clouds had declined by 20-50% since the 1970s due to urban sprawl and carbon emissions. Furthermore, a study by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 2019 showcases that the inflation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could wipe out the marine stratus clouds for good, potentially triggering a spike in intense weather patterns caused by global warming. The loss of the marine layer is a legitimate example of how climate change is already initiating weather extremes. 
      </p>

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        These heavy gray clouds serve as a natural heat shield for heavily populated coasts. The marine layer is formed by the onshore winds that blow along the California coast due to lower pressure that is inland in California. When the sea breeze blows across cold water, the air is chilled and water vapor condenses. Extreme heat waves will push downward in the atmosphere and squeeze the protective marine layer out. 
      </p>

      <p id="paragraphnews">
        It is predicted that there will be drastic impacts in the near future because of the loss of the marine layer. These clouds add a bit of moisture to vegetation and soil in the form of a drizzle or mist. Without this moisture, we are going to experience extremely hot summer days. Additionally, California experienced record dry temperatures in January, February, and March, as there was little to no precipitation. Increased heat waves, loss of moisture from the marine layer, and a lack of rain during winters will indefinitely lead to more frequent wildfires in our local mountain ranges. Prepare for high fire danger in Autumn!
